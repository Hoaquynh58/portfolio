# ðŸ§ª Manual Testing Portfolio â€“ Hoa Huong Quynh

Welcome to my QA/Manual Testing portfolio!  
I'm Hoa Huong Quynh, a passionate manual tester with hands-on experience in writing test cases, performing functional/API testing, and working with real-world systems such as e-invoice platforms and cinema booking apps.  

This repository showcases my academic projects, internship tasks, and practical testing deliverables â€” including test cases, bug reports, and Postman collections.
